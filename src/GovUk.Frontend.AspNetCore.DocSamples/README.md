## Overview

This project contains a collection of sample usages of each govuk-frontend component.
Each sample is shown within an otherwise empty HTML/Razor page.

The project `GovUk.Frontend.AspNetCore.DocSamplesScreenshotter` then uses these samples to generate screenshots used within the documentation (`docs/components/*.md`).

If you run this project locally, you can view the samples in your browser.
The homepage lists all samples next to the corresponding source code used to generate it, and provides links to view each one in isolation.
